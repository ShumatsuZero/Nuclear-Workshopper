# Nuclear Workshopper 0.2
*With Offiry's permission I fixed and updated the program.*
*It's basically the same program but updated.*

## What it does:
- Gathers PUBLIC ONLY data such as views, subscribers, favorites, size, description, type of file (aircraft livery or mission) and exports it as XLSX table.
- Fetches aircraft data from the description (e.g. If you have "A-19" or "Brawler" in the description it will put "A-19" in aircraft type column in table).

## What has changed:
- New interface, console output instead of window, a lot more details are shown.
- Every aircraft that is now in-game(0.32.3) is on the "airframes list".
- Fix for Steam anti-ddos Error 429 "Too Many Requests". Program will pause when encountered with this error and wait until you manually resume it (Downtime is around 5 minutes). This error could be encountered by users with workshop file list bigger than 50 or so files.
- Exported table now shows year 2026 as current one for this year files, with the same formatting as every other year.
- New cool icon I guess.

## Why:
- Because my workshop has reached quite a big number of liveries and I wanted to use this program to kinda keep tracking of what I do and how it does on the workshop but it ddosed steam because of big number.

## Instructions: 
- Basically the same, but you would need to press "resume" button after 5 minutes of steam protection.
- More clear ones are inside the program.

## Known issues:
- Awards are broken rn, Steam updated awards and now they count differently, haven't figured out how they are counted though so it's basically a 000000 column.
